                <h2>MEDIA</h2>
<p>The idea of Boat Club (CBC) was first conceived by the then Chief of Naval Staff of Bangladesh Navy, Late
    Rear Admiral Sultan Ahmed. The intention was to develop a Club which would perform like an organization
    where the elites of Maritime Agencies, Civil Industries, Bureaucrats and Military services would enjoy the
    normal Club facilities including aquatic sports through the Club and also to take part to contribute
    something for the sea- dependent people while the Club facilities would be fulfleged. Hence, the CBC was
    registered in the Joint Stock Companies in 1986. Thereafter, the former Chief of Naval Staff of Bangladesh
    Navy, Late Rear Admiral Sultan Ahmed, inaugurated the CBC on 08 Aug 1990. Bangladesh Navy took lease 5.0
    acres of land from Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) to establish the CBC. CPA gave this land beside Marine
    Academy Jetty at East Patenga. The Club premises have Karnaphuli river on the East and Khal Noâ€“11 on the
    North, Shah Amanat International Airport on South-West, Airforce Base Zahur on West. It has a wonderful
    panoramic view with hill, river and other natural beauty in the surrounding area. As per Article of
    Association and Memorandum of Understanding 1913, the Chief of Naval Staff would be the President of CBC.
    Then, COMBAN (Commodore Commanding BN Flotilla) would be the Vice-President and Later COMCHIT(Commodore
    Commanding Chittagong) took over the duty of Vice President. Other three Vice-Presidents and 17 members from
    the Civil Elites and Military Officers formed the Management Committee(The Committee). The Committee
    proposed to build the CBC Building as per the then master plan vide letter no COMCHIT/CBC-90/1689 dated 10
    July 2005 but that master plan could not be realized into actions. Few Club activities were arranged by the
    Club members various time. For improving environmental effects, plantation was done at Chittagong Boat Club
    Premises. With the support of Bangladesh Navy Boat Club Accommodation and Store Room was built vide letter
    no COMCHIT-90/2936 dated 15 Dec 2005. Purchase, sinking and installations of a deep tube- well with a good
    capacity pump and an overhead tank for storage of water were completed at Chittagong Boat Club (CBC) vide
    COMCHIT letter no COMCHIT-90/2936 dated 15 Dec 2005.Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) Chairman Commodore M
    Farooq, (E), psc, BN agreed to provide one pontoon and one causeway to Chittagong Boat Club. The Managing
    Director of ,Chittagong Dry Dock Limited (CDDL), Engineer Enamul Hoque Baqui, agreed to build a causeway
    with fund provided by Chittagong Port Authority. The pontoon is moored in the riverside of the Boat Club and
    the causeway was later fixed in the present position.</p>
